 Provides a complete integration between Mocha test framework and Zabbix
 monitoring system. Tests are executed periodically via systemd timer and
 results are exposed to Zabbix through custom UserParameters.
 .
 Features:
  - Zabbix agent2 UserParameter for reading Mocha JSON reports
  - systemd service and timer for automated test execution
  - Pre-configured Zabbix template for test monitoring
  - Triggers for test failures and stale results
 .
 This package does not require Zabbix to run browsers or tests directly.
